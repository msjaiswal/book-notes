## Managing Cash Flows - Inflows and Outflows 
Move the money away from temptation.

3 Bank Accounts: 
1. Salary Account = Income Account 
2. Spend-it Account 
3. Invest-it Account (Savings)

As soon as your salary hits your Income Account, move out your monthly expenditure to Spend-it Account and rest to Invest-it Account.
Put the above system in place. 

Moving money from Invest-it account to spend-it account is not allowed.

Putting label on money prevents peple from spending it for any other purpose. 
Pay off the high cost loanbefore spending. 

You are doing OK if: 
* You have 3 accounts that separate Income, Spending and Savings
* Living Costs <= 40-50% of take-home salary
* EMI <= 25-30% of take-home salary
* Savings <= 15-20% of take-home salary

## Emergency Funds!

"Why dont you invest for the long term?"  ... "What if there is an emergency?"
Having an emergency fund gives you a cusion.
Six months of Living Costs.

## Managing Cash Flows - Inflows and Outflows 
Move the money away from temptation.

3 Bank Accounts: 
1. Salary Account = Income Account 
2. Spend-it Account 
3. Invest-it Account (Savings)

As soon as your salary hits your Income Account, move out your monthly expenditure to Spend-it Account and rest to Invest-it Account.
Put the above system in place. 

Moving money from Invest-it account to spend-it account is not allowed.

Putting label on money prevents peple from spending it for any other purpose. 
Pay off the high cost loanbefore spending. 

You are doing OK if: 
* You have 3 accounts that separate Income, Spending and Savings
* Living Costs <= 40-50% of take-home salary
* EMI <= 25-30% of take-home salary
* Savings <= 15-20% of take-home salary

## Emergency Funds!

"Why dont you invest for the long term?"  ... "What if there is an emergency?"
Having an emergency fund gives you a cusion.
Six months of Living Costs. 

**Where to Keep this Money ?**
You need to move it to a place that is not that easy ti access, but yet is liquid enough to be of use when you want it and gives a return that is better than a savings deposit. 
Options: 
* Flexi FDs.
* Divide your funds into smaller FDs
* Short Term Debt Funds (Mutual Fund). Better than FDs in terms of liquiditity and tax-savings. 

Keep crediting your emergency fund every month. 


## Mediclaims - Build your protection 
You must have your own cover and not the one given by your company. 
Getting a good medical cover is probably more important than buying life insurance - you ar emore likely to go to the hospital with an illness or accident than die. 
Companies are reluctant to cover older people and people with diseases. 
In metros, you need 15 lakhs of cover. 

**What policy to buy?** 
Call your financial planner. It's impossible for an average person to know enough to buy a policy.
3 things to consider: 
1. Price
    * How does the price compares with policies from other companies right nowand how does the price compare over the years? 
    * Your policy may cost least today but may become the most expensive when you hit age sixty or seventy. 
    * Ask your agent to show you the price comparison at ten-year difference.
2. Benefits
    * Ensure that yyou have a policy that does not have something called a 'co-pay' clause. 
    * Check for a 'pre-existing' disease clause.
    * Check to see  how long is the waiting period.
    * Check if your policy has a 'disease waiting period'.
    * Check if your policy has 'sub-limits'. Example: Only 1% of total cover can be spent on room rent. 
    * Check for exclusions i.e. a list of diseases, conditions and medical services that policy does not cover. 
    * Ask how much of the costs before and after hospitalization the policy will cover. 
    * Ask for a list of 'day-care' procedures that don't need you to stay for twenty-for hours in a hospital any more.
    
    
3. Claims 


You are doing OK if: 
* Along with work, you have your own cover.
* You have 15 lakhs of cover.

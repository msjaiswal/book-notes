## Introduction 
"Engineering is easy, people are hard." - VP Engg @ Google
Key to a project success is not just writing great code, the way people collaborated towards the end goal matters just as much. 
Play well with others. 
People are basically a giant pile of intermittent bugs. 

One's team directly affects individual's productivity and happiness.

Writing software is a team sport, and human factors involved have as much influence on the outcome as the technical factors. 
If you invest in the "soft skills" of engineering, you can have a much greater impact for the same amount of effort. 
=> Investing in soft skills is a High Leverage activity.


## The Myth of a genious programmer. 
People are inherently imperfect. Beut befoe finding bugs in others, you need to understand bugs in yourself.
Think about your own reactions behaviour and attitudes. 
You need to reorganize your behaviours around the core principles of humility, respect and trust. 

### Help me hide my code.
People have tendency to hide their unfinished code. Why? 
Answer: Insecurity - People are afraid of others seeing and judging their work in progress. It;s just human nature. 

### The Genius Myth
Media projects one person as hero - Michael Jordan. But. His team played a vital role in MJ's success. 
Linus trovalds DID NOT write whole of Linux himself. He just wrote beginning of Linux. Linux's real achievement to lead 100's of open source contributors. 
Bill Gates DID NOT write whole of Microsoft himself. Hea created first version of DOS. His bigger acievement was building a company. 

"There is a team behind every hero!"

Humans have a natural instinct to locate leaders and role models, idolize them and attempt to imitate them. 
Deep down we all secretly wish to be a geniouses. But. Reality Check. You are probably not a geniuos.

Most programmers are afraid to share their work if they've only just started. People will see their mistakes and know that you are not a genious.
#### Hiding is harmful. 
- If you do everything alone, how do you even know if you are on the right track?!
- Its easy to make fundamental design mistakes early on. You risk inventing wheels. 
- Fail  early, fail fast, fail often. 
- Bus Factor! 
- As programmers, we work best in tight feedback loops. 
- "Many eyes make every bug shallow." - Eric Raymond

Software today is written by teams not individuals, and a high-bandwidth, readily available connection to the rest of your team is even more avaluable than your Internet connection.

#### It's all about the Team 
- Creating the superstar team is the real goal, and is fiendishly difficult. 
- Software development is a team sport. 
- Share your vision. Divide your labor. Learn from others. Create a brilliant team. 

#### 3 Pillars of a Great Team 
- Humility: You are not the centre of the universe. 
- Respect: You genuinely cate about others you work with. 
- Trust: You believe that others are cometent and will do the right thing and you're OK letting them drive when appropriate. 

---> Almost every social conflict can be traced back to lack of humility, trust or respect. 

Do not underestimate the power of playing the social game. It's not about tricking or manipulating people; it's about creating relationships to get things done, and relationships always outlasts projects. 

#### Lose the Ego
Nobody wants to work with a person who consistently behaves like he is the most important person in the room. 
Don't come off as "know-it-all". Build a "collective ego". Build a sense of team accomplishment and group pride. 

Your self worth shoouldn't be connected to code you write. 
You are not what you make. 

#### Fail Fast and Iterate
"Failure is an option" - motto at google. 
The key to learning from your mistakes is to document your failures. Don't erase your tracks  - light them up like a runway for those who follow you. 

#### Leave time for Learning
Let's face it: it is fun being the most knowledgeble person in the room, and mentoring others can be incerdibly rewarding. 
But once you reach a local maxima, you stop learning. 

- The more you are open to influence, the more you are able to influence; the more vulnerable you are, the stronger you appear. 
Admitting you have made a mistaleor you're simply out of your league is a way to increase your status over the long run.

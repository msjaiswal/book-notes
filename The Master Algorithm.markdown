Machine Learning is a game changing technology. Its not wise to let it remain a black box

##### Thinking a decade ago: 
You don't really understand something unless you can express it as an algorithm.
Ways to express complexity of an algorithm: time complexity and space complexity. 

Let's introduce a new type of complexity: Human Complexity
- When algorithms become too complex for our poor brains to understand.

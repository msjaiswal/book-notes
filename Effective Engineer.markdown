# Effective Engineer

### Invest in Iteration Speed 
- Continuous Deployment
- Will save a lot of time in manual deployment of code.

### Reduce Operational Complexity
- Keep no. of technologies low. Don’t sway towards shiny new technologies.
- Do the simple thing first
- ** Simplicity **
- Simplify the architecture to reduce their operational burden. 
- “What’s the simplest solution that can get the job done while also reducing our future operational burden?” 

### Fail Fast 
- doesn’t necessarily mean crashing your programs for users 
- fail-fast  to surface issues immediately 

### Relentlessly Automate
- Automating mechanics is good.
- Automating decision making - no.
- Hone Your Ability to Respond and Recover Quickly 
    - Leverage ( Recovering quickly ) > Leverage ( Preventing Failures )
- “script for success,” practice failure scenarios, and work on our ability to recover quickly. 

**"You’re a staff engineer if you’re making a whole team better than it would be otherwise. You’re a principal engineer if you’re making the whole company better than it would be otherwise. And you’re distinguished if you’re improving the industry.”**
￼
- Automated testcases lead to higher confidence when refactoring.
- Write test cases when the code is fresh in mind.
- Don’t be dogmatic about 100% code coverage.
- Value of tests increases over time and cost to write goes down. 

### Technical Debt
- Taking technical debt is fine as far as it is repaid within time. 

### Measure What You Want to Improve
- If you can’t measure it, you can’t improve it 
- Good Metric
    - They help you focus on the right things 
    - Drives forward progress.

- Choose metrics that  
    - 1) maximize impact, 
    - 2) are actionable, 
    - 3) are responsive yet robust.

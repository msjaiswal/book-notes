## Pragmatic Programmer

* Take Responsibility - Provide Options, Don't Make Lame Excuses 
* Don't Live with Broken Windows (bad designs, wrong decisions, or poor code )
* Be a Catalyst for Change

### Good-Enough Software 
* Make Quality a Requirements Issue 

### Invest Regularly in Your Knowledge Portfolio 
On gurus:
- Frame your question carefully and politely. Remember that you're asking a favor; don't seem to be demanding an answer. 

### Communicate! 
- Adjust the style of your delivery to suit your audience.
- Your ideas are important. They deserve a good-looking vehicle to convey them to your audience. 
- Choose your moment.
- Get back to people ****

### Keep it try - duh! 
- Tradeoff: Not DRY Vs High Coupling. 
    - MJ: Keep it not dry and write a cron to ensure things remain same.
- Make it easy to reuse
- Orthogonal. Eliminate effects between unrelated things.

**Nothing is more dangerous than an idea if it’s the only one you have.**
- There are no final decisions
- Estimate to avoid surprises.

### Debugging
- Before debugging, set the right mindset. Turn off defences for ego, pressure and relax. Don’t panic. 
- Make it reproducible.
- Rubber ducking Explain it to someone.
- Binary Search :P

### Design By Contract
- If it can’t happen, use assertions to make sure that it won’t. 
- Finish what you start - close files etc. 

### Minimize Coupling 
- Good fences make good neighbors. 

- Make system highly configurable.
- Design using services. 

- Refactor early, refactor often.

### Design to Test
- Ad hoc testing - don’t throw away your test case. Add it to existing unit tests
- Test your software or users will.

**Perfection is achieved, not when there is nothing left to add but when there is nothing to throw away.**

- Don’t be a slave to formal methods like UML etc.
- Civilisations advance by extending the number of important operations we can perform without thinking about them. 


Test early, Test often. Test Automatically. 
- The earlier a bug is found, the cheaper it is to remedy. 
- Find bugs one. If a human finds a bug, that should be the last time a human finds that bug.

Pride and Prejudice
- Sign your work.
